# Reporting an issue
If there is something wrong or missing on our servers, you can report an issue.
An issue can be a [bug](#bugs), a [feature request](#features) or a [problem with your time](#missingwrong-times) (e.g.: server didn't count it).

The following describes how to report an issue.

## Bugs
If you encounter a bug, go to the `Issues` tab, check if the bug was already reported.
- If yes, you can check out that issue more information if something is missing.
- If no, click on `New Issue` and select the template `Bug report` and fill in the requested information.

## Features
If you're missing a feature or think you have a great idea, tell us about it.

Go to the `Issues` tab, check if the feature was already proposed.
- If yes, feel free to participate in the discussion inside the issue.
- If no, click on `New Issue` and select the template `Feature request` and fill in the requested information.

## Missing/Wrong Times
If you played a map from start to finish, but your time isn't updated correctly,
go to the `Issues` tab, click `New Issue` and select the template `Time is missing or wrong` and fill in the requested information.

## What happens next?
Your issue will receive a `needs approval` tag in order for us to know which issue we already looked at.
After looking at the issue, a team member will decide if the issue is valid or not.
Depending on this decision the issue will either get closed with the tag `wont fix` or it will get assigned to a team member
which will work on the resolution on the problem. So just stay patient,
you'll get a github notification if something happens on your created issue.

# Etiquette/Disclaimer
It can be frustrating to lose a good run to a bug. We know that. But the communication should still stay polite at all times.

Decisions made by the team are made after evaluating all of the available information. These decisions are final.
